# Analysis of Star Wars Survey

This project will attempt to identify the most popular Star Wars film by analysing the results of a Star Wars survey conducted by FiveThirtyEight. The report will also take a look out how the respondent's age and gender influence their response. 

The data used for this analysis was collected by FiveThirtyEight in 2014 using the online tool SurveyMonkey. The survey received a total of 835 responses and includes information regarding the respondent's gender, age, household income, education and location. It data is publicly available [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey).  

This project was completed as part of the "Data Cleaning Project Walkthrough" course by [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/course/data-exploration/).
